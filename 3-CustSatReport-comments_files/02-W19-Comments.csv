All the TSG services are very good in fact excellent. Only once did I think that the help desk wasn't very efficient.
"As for the service desk - Sean Austin is an absolute shining star. Sean is so quick to respond so patient and very willing to persist until he finds a solution. He continues to be a highlight for us in working with TSG. Lisa Darling is also always very willing to help and very gracious.
 Enterprise continues to be a challenge. It looks like a program that hasn't been updated since 1999 and often runs like one. I continue (again and again) to have problems accessing it and generally find it slow and unhelpful. It seems as though there are enough departments and employees who utilize this program on a regular basis that the situation warrants improvement. The time to change from this program was over a decade ago. It is hard for me to understand why we are using such an out-of-date system and why we are paying someone a full-time salary with benefits to support this program. Their time (and the organization's money) would be better served if they were tasked with finding a new program and a way to transfer the data securely ASAP. Could this not happen by the end of 2019? Overall TSG does such a wonderful job supporting this organization and Enterprise feels like an outlying low point. It would help so many to have a functional program. Thank you!"
Everybody in the TSG team is great!
I came onboard with TMC in November 2018 and interacted with TSG several times during my initial week. Everyone I encountered was very responsive and helpful with my technical issues. Sean in particular was quite responsive and knowledgeable. 
"I docked business applications support by a point because I feel that we've been left straddling between Enterprise and Salesforce. Salesforce feels like it could be an amazing tool for departments to store information on the people they connect with and for that information to be appropriately and simply made available between departments.

My experience with the business applications support staff has been more than  satisfactory. They are joyful effective responsive and empathetic. You all are clearly doing everything you can to offer the best tech support to the church possible and that is felt. Just wanted to highlight an area for improvement that would make a significant difference from my point of view.

Thank you all so much for what you do which I value infinitely."
I love working with TSG and BMPS. Great teams! Thank you for their help & support over the years.
I'd just like to say that I appreciate that the staff is friendly and I never feel like I'm being talked down to. 
It seemed to take an excessively long time for TSG to find out the problem couldn't be fixed off site.  Also was inconvenienced on one occasion by having to bring work laptop unnecessarily to Boston (also cost TMC travel expenses)
"It would be nice to know if the TSG team are available to help with individual computer problems. Often the answer can be found via a Google search but this is not always the case. Up until now I have felt that I should not raise these sorts of queries as the team have more important calls on their time. As a very modest example I have an issue at present with my iPad not syncing to my MacBook Pro so that JSH articles which I have saved in iBooks on my iPad are not appearing in iBooks in my Mac. My feeling is that this is something I must resolve without 'bothering' the TSG team. 
On a different note it might be helpful to know projected time responses for dealing with an issue."
"It's hard to lose folks that had an in-depth understanding and historical knowledge of systems processes etc. So much we do is not out of the box but customized and it takes more time to get answers through the helpdesk and otherwise and often with more back and forth than it used to. 

Also not all PMs send meeting minutes recapping what was discussed what action items are assigend to who next steps etc. I feel that is extremely helpful for the success and progress of a project and should be required as part of the PM role on a project. It would also be good if PMs had a strong understanding of all systems processes etc. involved in a project. Sometimes a lack of understanding can be a significant roadblock in moving a project forward."
"My interactions with the TSG help desk are always pleasant and helpful. 
Tech support for meetings and presentations is always helpful as well.
Thanks for what you do for our organization!"
Sean Austin and Paul Doherty have been incredibly helpful and wonderful to work with.
Sometimes it takes many days for TSG to help me. I also find that some people are much more helpful than others. I spent *hours* (over multiple days) working with someone who did not know what they were doing at all. I ended up calling Kami because I knew she could help me. It turned out to be a very simple fix... I am always never to call TSG help line directly because I never know if I will get someone who can help me in a timely manner or not...
Sometimes there has been a disconnect between work completed by TSG and emails they send me asking to complete work (that has already been done). Otherwise they are great!
TSG is always very responsive knowledgeable and professional in addressing whatever issue I've had. 
TSG staff are always courteous and pleasant to work with. Some are much more knowledgeable than others but there is always a desire to help and to find the solution even if one staff member can't find it themselves. While this may not be something TSG can control directly we have had extreme challenges with Enterprise in the last several months. Issues are still unresolved and I understand the system itself is quite out dated. Please consider a new system that is more intuitive easy to use and with less bugs. Thank you for everything you do - we are so grateful you're all just a phone call away!
You guys do a wonderful job keep up the awesome work.
