1,1,"""1) I love working with all the departments. Everyone wants to help and they usually do a great job.",pos
2,2,2) Recommendation: It would be good to have an estimated response time email that automatically goes out (especially if the call goes to x3111 voicemail).,pos
3,3,At the Reading Room we are a bit more of a challenge to TSG because some of our technology needs are unique. That said we are a public facing department and need to know that our technology will work — or at worse an expected repair time.,neg
4,4,When I call I either get voicemail or a person that says they will put in a ticket or get told that someone will be down soon. They could show up anytime between 30 minutes later and the next day. I will get asked by my manager and coworkers multiple times when the problem will be resolved. If I could give them an estimated time of repair that would make it easier for us. I am sure other departments may find that useful too.,pos
5,5,3) There are very rare — very rare — times when our tickets seem to be lost or overlooked. For example we are still waiting for security cables to lock down our touchscreen tablets that were installed in the TMC RR in May 2018.,neg
6,6,"""As for the service desk - Sean Austin is an absolute shining star. Sean is so quick to respond so patient and very willing to persist until he finds a solution. He continues to be a highlight for us in working with TSG. Lisa Darling is also always very willing to help and very gracious.",pos
7,7,Better service desk help needed for remote employees.,pos
8,8,Congrats on response time and being cheerfully available when needed!,pos
9,9,Everybody in the TSG team is great!,pos
10,10,Everyone at TSG is great!,pos
11,11,Great job TSG! Thank you for all you do.,pos
12,12,"""Helpdesk: Sometimes the representative will keep you on hold unnecessarily when you could have gotten a simple call back. I have a hard time working with Lisa and Maurice because of how they conduct themselves on the telephone. Very kind people so there is no problem there but could conduct themselves in a more professional way.",pos
13,13,"General support/CSM accounts:Tony Veidelis and Sean Austin have been exceptional and it is always a pleasure to work with them. They go above and beyond.""",pos
14,14,I came onboard with TMC in November 2018 and interacted with TSG several times during my initial week. Everyone I encountered was very responsive and helpful with my technical issues. Sean in particular was quite responsive and knowledgeable.,pos
15,15,My experience with the business applications support staff has been more than satisfactory. They are joyful effective responsive and empathetic. You all are clearly doing everything you can to offer the best tech support to the church possible and that is felt. Just wanted to highlight an area for improvement that would make a significant difference from my point of view.,pos
16,16,"Thank you all so much for what you do which I value infinitely.""",pos
17,17,I love working with TSG and BMPS. Great teams! Thank you for their help & support over the years.,pos
18,18,I mainly use the Service Desk and am always grateful for their loving and prompt support! Sean has helped me many many many times and is always patient kind and effective! Lisa and Maurice have been a wonderful support as well. The one thing I have heard from other staff members in my department is that Enterprise is a pain point in their work. They feel Enterprise requires extra work and time (i.e. calling TSG) to enter it nearly every single time they need to access the program and that the program is slow inefficient outdated and hard to use. I have not had to use this program but it comes up regularly in department discussions.,neg
19,19,"""I mostly work with TSG folks above and they are SUPER! That having been said I know that some are newer and are working to get up to speed on TMC applications etc. But there are two individuals that continue to absolutely shine in their work with me (and others by observation) and go the extra mile in attitude courteous-ness etc.",pos
20,20,"""In most cases TSG is very responsive.",pos
21,21,1) Everyone at the help desk Lisa Maurice Sean and Kami have always followed through on getting things up and running as they are supposed to. Some of them have swung by on their lunch breaks to check in and be sure that an attempted fix has been successful. Dave Palefsky Paul and Vad always get the job done and usually with incredibly great humor. I rarely see Ben or John but they gets things fixed too.,pos
22,22,1) We are still hoping TSG can find some software that will allow us to lock down our public Mac so that visitors can reach all the CS websites but not have access to anything else. We use parental controls but they have been too glitchy thus far.,neu
23,23,"TSG does a great job. Sometimes it is clear they need another staffer.""",pos
24,24,"On a different note it might be helpful to know projected time responses for dealing with an issue.""",neg
25,25,"Also not all PMs send meeting minutes recapping what was discussed what action items are assigend to who next steps etc. I feel that is extremely helpful for the success and progress of a project and should be required as part of the PM role on a project. It would also be good if PMs had a strong understanding of all systems processes etc. involved in a project. Sometimes a lack of understanding can be a significant roadblock in moving a project forward.""",pos
26,26,"""My interactions with the TSG help desk are always pleasant and helpful.",pos
27,27,Tech support for meetings and presentations is always helpful as well.,pos
28,28,"Thanks for what you do for our organization!""",pos
29,29,neutral answers are because I do not receive these services in my position (changed to NA do not use in order to clean up data - MAL),neg
30,30,No further comment.,neu
31,31,Prompt responses wonderfully skilled generous and thorough in answering questions always provides a resolution. Thank you!,pos
32,32,Salesforce is inferior and less responsive to our needs than our previous vendor.,neg
33,33,Sean Austin and Paul Doherty have been incredibly helpful and wonderful to work with.,pos
34,34,Sometimes it takes many days for TSG to help me. I also find that some people are much more helpful than others. I spent *hours* (over multiple days) working with someone who did not know what they were doing at all. I ended up calling Kami because I knew she could help me. It turned out to be a very simple fix... I am always never to call TSG help line directly because I never know if I will get someone who can help me in a timely manner or not...,neg
35,35,Sometimes there has been a disconnect between work completed by TSG and emails they send me asking to complete work (that has already been done). Otherwise they are great!,pos
36,36,Thank You!,pos
37,37,The service desk goes out of their way to be helpful.,pos
38,38,The Service Desk is always so helpful!,pos
39,39,They are always willing and capable to help - and always with a smile!,pos
40,40,TSG is always helpful and efficient,pos
41,41,TSG should strive to respond in a timely manner.,pos
42,42,"""TSG support of business applications is timely though the business applications themselves have not consistently met the needs of our department. (Enterprise has gone done on a number of occasions and Salesforce has not yet implemented cloud services.)",pos
43,43,Usually very good on deadline when I need help.,pos
44,44,We need scheduling software and we need it adapted to our needs. I know that can be problematic with possible upgrades but this is definitely an area we should put manpower into or even money on!,neg
45,45,Whomever it was who helped me back in February (Sean?) when I was away from my office and needed tech support to retrieve an important e-mail was outstanding in the level of service he gave me. He was not only skilled and efficient but so warm and friendly--important qualities when someone is in a stressful situation that tech problems seem to create. Thank you TSG!,pos
46,46,You guys do a wonderful job keep up the awesome work.,pos
