"2","01-F18","1) I love working with all the departments. Everyone wants to help and they usually do a great job.

2) Recommendation: It would be good to have an ""estimated response time"" email that automatically goes out (especially if the call goes to x3111 voicemail).

At the Reading Room we are a bit more of a challenge to TSG because some of our technology needs are unique. That said, we are a public facing department and need to know that our technology will work — or, at worse, an expected repair time.

When I call I either get voicemail, or a person that says they will put in a ticket, or get told that someone will be down soon. They could show up anytime between 30 minutes later and the next day. I will get asked by my manager and coworkers, multiple times, when the problem will be resolved. If I could give them an estimated time of repair, that would make it easier for us. I am sure other departments may find that useful, too.

3),  There are very rare — very rare — times when our tickets seem to be lost or overlooked. For example, we are still waiting for security cables to lock down our touchscreen tablets that were installed in the TMC RR in May 2018.

4) Also, I don't know if the ""Event Services"" refers to BMPS helping out with bringing a sound engineer and equipment to TMC RR events? If so, then I would rate it ""satisfactory."""

"16","01-F18","TSG support of business applications is timely, though the business applications themselves have not consistently met the needs of our department. (Enterprise has gone done on a number of occasions, and Salesforce has not yet implemented cloud services.)

Slow implementation of Salesforce cloud services (more than 1 year behind schedule) is negatively affecting ISD's & Customer Care Center's ability to have a backup employee for ISD in a crucial role, because we have not been able to train someone on the new cloud service. (To train the backup on the current service would require duplicating work when cloud service is implemented). We understand that this delay is due to Salesforce techs needing to customize the configuration for TMC/CSPS, because they did not deliver what they originally promised. We also recognize that managing this process has required significant human resources from TSG for vendor management, but hope that more TSG resources can be devoted to managing the vendor relationship with Salesforce so that the cloud service can be implemented ASAP."

"18","01-F18","The one area that I would not quite say I'm satisfied with is support for M-Files.  Austin has always been fantastic to work with (as was Stephanie), but without an admin who is able to devote a bit more time to refining the system and addressing the issues that are not urgent but still important, ORM has found itself putting off projects or aspects of data clean up with no clear plan for when they can be addressed."

"29","01-F18","I mostly work with TSG folks above, and they are SUPER! That having been said, I know that some are newer and are working to get up to speed on TMC applications etc. But there are two individuals that continue to absolutely shine in their work with me (and others, by observation) and go the extra mile in attitude, courteous-ness, etc. 

That having been said, I did have one difficulty recently with one of my service ticket requests that had a short time frame, placed on a Thursday, followed up with a personal email to one employee that I had asked questions along these lines before. I was surprised to not hear from them at all, either by email or in response to the TSG ticket, until I happen to be talking to that person on Monday but the event was past by that time. I was too busy on the Friday to follow up, as I should have. I was also a little vague in my time frame, too. I didn't follow up when I became aware their help would have been nice to receive by that Friday. It  occasionally appears to me that they are SO busy, they don't always have the time to follow up. Do we possibly need one more employee in that part of things?

On the flip side, occasionally I find that I cannot help with the follow up they may want to do (they are being proactive) because it takes up so much time that I often don't have, and I sometimes have to abandon a particular issue, especially as it relates to getting into my computer during work hours. Sorry! Also, very rarely, I have done a quick Google search and found the answer myself. Thank you to TSG for all you guys do! Not an easy job. :)"
"30","01-F18","Helpdesk: Sometimes the representative will keep you on hold unnecessarily when you could have gotten a simple call back. I have a hard time working with Lisa and Maurice because of how they conduct themselves on the telephone. Very kind people, so there is no problem there, but could conduct themselves in a more professional way.

General support/CSM accounts:Tony Veidelis and Sean Austin have been exceptional and it is always a pleasure to work with them. They go above and beyond."

"38","02-W19","Sometimes it takes many days for TSG to help me. I also find that some people are much more helpful than others. I spent *hours* (over multiple days) working with someone who did not know what they were doing at all. I ended up calling Kami because I knew she could help me. It turned out to be a very simple fix... I am always never to call TSG help line directly because I never know if I will get someone who can help me in a timely manner or not..."

"40","02-W19","It's hard to lose folks that had an in-depth understanding and historical knowledge of systems, processes, etc. So much we do is not out of the box but customized and it takes more time to get answers, through the helpdesk and otherwise, and often with more back and forth, than it used to. 

Also, not all PMs send meeting minutes, recapping what was discussed, what action items are assigend to who, next steps, etc. I feel that is extremely helpful for the success and progress of a project and should be required as part of the PM role on a project. It would also be good if PMs had a strong understanding of all systems, processes, etc. involved in a project. Sometimes a lack of understanding can be a significant roadblock in moving a project forward."
"41","02-W19","As for the service desk - Sean Austin is an absolute shining star. Sean is so quick to respond, so patient and very willing to persist until he finds a solution. He continues to be a highlight for us in working with TSG. Lisa Darling is also always very willing to help and very gracious.
 Enterprise continues to be a challenge. It looks like a program that hasn't been updated since 1999, and often runs like one. I continue (again and again) to have problems accessing it, and generally find it slow and unhelpful. It seems as though there are enough departments and employees who utilize this program on a regular basis that the situation warrants improvement. The time to change from this program was over a decade ago. It is hard for me to understand why we are using such an out-of-date system and why we are paying someone a full-time salary with benefits to support this program. Their time (and the organization's money) would be better served if they were tasked with finding a new program and a way to transfer the data securely, ASAP. Could this not happen by the end of 2019? Overall, TSG does such a wonderful job supporting this organization, and Enterprise feels like an outlying low point. It would help so many to have a functional program. Thank you!"

"45","02-W19","It would be nice to know if the TSG team are available to help with individual computer problems. Often the answer can be found via a Google search but this is not always the case. Up until now I have felt that I should not raise these sorts of queries as the team have more important calls on their time. As a very modest example, I have an issue at present with my iPad not syncing to my MacBook Pro so that JSH articles which I have saved in iBooks on my iPad are not appearing in iBooks in my Mac. My feeling is that this is something I must resolve without 'bothering' the TSG team. 
On a different note it might be helpful to know projected time responses for dealing with an issue."
"46","02-W19","My interactions with the TSG help desk are always pleasant and helpful. 
Tech support for meetings and presentations is always helpful as well.
Thanks for what you do for our organization!"

"57","02-W19","I docked business applications support by a point because I feel that we've been left straddling between Enterprise and Salesforce. Salesforce feels like it could be an amazing tool for departments to store information on the people they connect with, and for that information to be appropriately and simply made available between departments.

My experience with the business applications support staff has been more than  satisfactory. They are joyful, effective, responsive and empathetic. You all are clearly doing everything you can to offer the best tech support to the church possible, and that is felt. Just wanted to highlight an area for improvement that would make a significant difference from my point of view.

Thank you all so much for what you do, which I value infinitely."

"68","02-W19","TSG staff are always courteous and pleasant to work with. Some are much more knowledgeable than others but there is always a desire to help and to find the solution even if one staff member can't find it themselves. While this may not be something TSG can control directly, we have had extreme challenges with Enterprise in the last several months. Issues are still unresolved and I understand the system itself is quite out dated. Please consider a new system that is more intuitive, easy to use, and with less bugs. Thank you for everything you do - we are so grateful you're all just a phone call away!"
"69","02-W19","Sometimes, there has been a disconnect between work completed by TSG and emails they send me asking to complete work (that has already been done). Otherwise, they are great!"

It's been 3 months and we haven't been able to get the necessary changes done at QuickBooks and a month and haven't been able to reconnect the RR's Gift Card program. Everything is in the process, but thank goodness for the flexibility of our customers while we work out these issues."

"90","03-S19","I mainly use the Service Desk and am always grateful for their loving and prompt support! Sean has helped me many many many times and is always patient, kind, and effective! Lisa and Maurice have been a wonderful support as well. The one thing I have heard from other staff members in my department is that Enterprise is a pain point in their work. They feel Enterprise requires extra work and time (i.e. calling TSG) to enter it nearly every single time they need to access the program, and that the program is slow, inefficient, outdated, and hard to use.  I have not had to use this program, but it comes up regularly in department discussions. "
"91","03-S19","NR"
"92","03-S19","In most cases TSG is very responsive. 

1) Everyone at the help desk, Lisa, Maurice, Sean and Kami, have always followed through on getting things up and running as they are supposed to. Some of them have swung by on their lunch breaks to check in and be sure that an attempted fix has been successful. Dave Palefsky, Paul, and Vad always get the job done and usually with incredibly great humor. I rarely see Ben or John, but they gets things fixed, too.

In other cases certain TSG-related things have taken months or more to respond, or we've been told TSG doesn't have the bandwidth to do the job presently.

1) We are still hoping TSG can find some software that will allow us to lock down our public Mac so that visitors can reach all the CS websites, but not have access to anything else. We use parental controls but they have been too glitchy thus far. 

2) In the case of our joint project with OPA, to develop touch sales tablets, the original plan called for TSG to do the design (web design). We were told they don't have the bandwidth and it was given back to me (Jonathan) to do. 

3) Al Belote, a very great guy and helpful when we talk with him, has not had the bandwidth to help us update one of our touchscreen tablets, (The ""What is Christian Science"" one that's been in use for almost four years and is the only tablet that TSG is fully responsible for.) It took a full year to get any changes made to it. 

TSG does a great job. Sometimes it is clear they need another staffer."

"114","03-S19","Whomever it was who helped me back in February (Sean?) when I was away from my office and needed tech support to retrieve an important e-mail, was outstanding in the level of service he gave me.  He was not only skilled and efficient, but so warm and friendly--important qualities when someone is in a stressful situation that tech problems seem to create.  Thank you, TSG!"
"115","03-S19","While I appreciate the good intentions/attitude of members of the Service Desk, they're inexperience often means that resolutions to tickets take too long and often create excessive work-stoppage, which has a big impact on our department. I would like to note that I greatly appreciate Sean Austin's excellent attitude and follow-through.  

Regarding Project support, the main individual I've worked with is Joey Jiang. She seems well-intentioned and friendly, however, she's often difficult to understand, occasionally may give the impression that she understands details when it doesn't seem that she does, frequently schedules unnecessary meetings, and, similarly, doesn't make the best use of meeting participants' time. The aforementioned observations sometimes cause a project due date to be delayed and/or the quality of the deliverable to be negatively impacted."
