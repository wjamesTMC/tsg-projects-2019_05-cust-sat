2) Recommendation: It would be good to have an ""estimated response time"" email that automatically goes out (especially if the call goes to x3111 voicemail).

At the Reading Room we are a bit more of a challenge to TSG because some of our technology needs are unique. That said, we are a public facing department and need to know that our technology will work ‚Äî or, at worse, an expected repair time.

When I call I either get voicemail, or a person that says they will put in a ticket, or get told that someone will be down soon. They could show up anytime between 30 minutes later and the next day. I will get asked by my manager and coworkers, multiple times, when the problem will be resolved. If I could give them an estimated time of repair, that would make it easier for us. I am sure other departments may find that useful, too.

3),  There are very rare ‚Äî very rare ‚Äî times when our tickets seem to be lost or overlooked. For example, we are still waiting for security cables to lock down our touchscreen tablets that were installed in the TMC RR in May 2018.

4) Also, I don't know if the ""Event Services"" refers to BMPS helping out with bringing a sound engineer and equipment to TMC RR events? If so, then I would rate it ""satisfactory."""

(Enterprise has gone done on a number of occasions, and Salesforce has not yet implemented cloud services.)

Slow implementation of Salesforce cloud services (more than 1 year behind schedule) is negatively affecting ISD's & Customer Care Center's ability to have a backup employee for ISD in a crucial role, because we have not been able to train someone on the new cloud service. (To train the backup on the current service would require duplicating work when cloud service is implemented). We understand that this delay is due to Salesforce techs needing to customize the configuration for TMC/CSPS, because they did not deliver what they originally promised. We also recognize that managing this process has required significant human resources from TSG for vendor management, but hope that more TSG resources can be devoted to managing the vendor relationship with Salesforce so that the cloud service can be implemented ASAP."

That having been said, I know that some are newer and are working to get up to speed on TMC applications etc. But there are two individuals that continue to absolutely shine in their work with me (and others, by observation) and go the extra mile in attitude, courteous-ness, etc. 

That having been said, I did have one difficulty recently with one of my service ticket requests that had a short time frame, placed on a Thursday, followed up with a personal email to one employee that I had asked questions along these lines before. I was surprised to not hear from them at all, either by email or in response to the TSG ticket, until I happen to be talking to that person on Monday but the event was past by that time. I was too busy on the Friday to follow up, as I should have. I was also a little vague in my time frame, too. I didn't follow up when I became aware their help would have been nice to receive by that Friday. It  occasionally appears to me that they are SO busy, they don't always have the time to follow up. Do we possibly need one more employee in that part of things?

On the flip side, occasionally I find that I cannot help with the follow up they may want to do (they are being proactive) because it takes up so much time that I often don't have, and I sometimes have to abandon a particular issue, especially as it relates to getting into my computer during work hours. Sorry! Also, very rarely, I have done a quick Google search and found the answer myself. Thank you to TSG for all you guys do! Not an easy job. :)"

Also, not all PMs send meeting minutes, recapping what was discussed, what action items are assigend to who, next steps, etc. I feel that is extremely helpful for the success and progress of a project and should be required as part of the PM role on a project.

Lisa Darling is also always very willing to help and very gracious.
 Enterprise continues to be a challenge. It looks like a program that hasn't been updated since 1999, and often runs like one. I continue (again and again) to have problems accessing it, and generally find it slow and unhelpful. It seems as though there are enough departments and employees who utilize this program on a regular basis that the situation warrants improvement. The time to change from this program was over a decade ago. It is hard for me to understand why we are using such an out-of-date system and why we are paying someone a full-time salary with benefits to support this program. Their time (and the organization's money) would be better served if they were tasked with finding a new program and a way to transfer the data securely, ASAP. Could this not happen by the end of 2019? Overall, TSG does such a wonderful job supporting this organization, and Enterprise feels like an outlying low point. It would help so many to have a functional program. Thank you!"

Sean has helped me many many many times and is always patient, kind, and effective! Lisa and Maurice have been a wonderful support as well. The one thing I have heard from other staff members in my department is that Enterprise is a pain point in their work. They feel Enterprise requires extra work and time (i.e. calling TSG) to enter it nearly every single time they need to access the program, and that the program is slow, inefficient, outdated, and hard to use.  I have not had to use this program, but it comes up regularly in department discussions. "

1) Everyone at the help desk, Lisa, Maurice, Sean and Kami, have always followed through on getting things up and running as they are supposed to. Some of them have swung by on their lunch breaks to check in and be sure that an attempted fix has been successful. Dave Palefsky, Paul, and Vad always get the job done and usually with incredibly great humor. I rarely see Ben or John, but they gets things fixed, too.

In other cases certain TSG-related things have taken months or more to respond, or we've been told TSG doesn't have the bandwidth to do the job presently.

1) We are still hoping TSG can find some software that will allow us to lock down our public Mac so that visitors can reach all the CS websites, but not have access to anything else. We use parental controls but they have been too glitchy thus far. 

2) In the case of our joint project with OPA, to develop touch sales tablets, the original plan called for TSG to do the design (web design). We were told they don't have the bandwidth and it was given back to me (Jonathan) to do. 

3) Al Belote, a very great guy and helpful when we talk with him, has not had the bandwidth to help us update one of our touchscreen tablets, (The ""What is Christian Science"" one that's been in use for almost four years and is the only tablet that TSG is fully responsible for.) It took a full year to get any changes made to it. 

TSG does a great job. Sometimes it is clear they need another staffer."

I would like to note that I greatly appreciate Sean Austin's excellent attitude and follow-through.  

Regarding Project support, the main individual I've worked with is Joey Jiang. She seems well-intentioned and friendly, however, she's often difficult to understand, occasionally may give the impression that she understands details when it doesn't seem that she does, frequently schedules unnecessary meetings, and, similarly, doesn't make the best use of meeting participants' time. The aforementioned observations sometimes cause a project due date to be delayed and/or the quality of the deliverable to be negatively impacted."

For an existing employee who is transitioning to a new role... Before you require them to get a new email account (as I was required to do), you should explain to them why it is necessary. It is a big upheaval to endure right at the time when you're learning a new job. Understanding that it truly is necessary could help make it more palatable. TSG should think through all the implications of the employee having to get a new account before you start the process, and you should offer to walk the employee through each piece. For example, ""May I help you set up the new account on your smart phone so you don't miss emails from your new boss?"" or ""Do you have any calendar appointments you'd like to keep that I can help you move over to your new account?"" etc etc"
