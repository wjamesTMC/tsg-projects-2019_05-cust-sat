"1) I love working with all the departments. Everyone wants to help and they usually do a great job.

2) Recommendation: It would be good to have an ""estimated response time"" email that automatically goes out (especially if the call goes to x3111 voicemail).

At the Reading Room we are a bit more of a challenge to TSG because some of our technology needs are unique. That said we are a public facing department and need to know that our technology will work — or at worse an expected repair time.

When I call I either get voicemail or a person that says they will put in a ticket or get told that someone will be down soon. They could show up anytime between 30 minutes later and the next day. I will get asked by my manager and coworkers multiple times when the problem will be resolved. If I could give them an estimated time of repair that would make it easier for us. I am sure other departments may find that useful too.

3)  There are very rare — very rare — times when our tickets seem to be lost or overlooked. For example we are still waiting for security cables to lock down our touchscreen tablets that were installed in the TMC RR in May 2018.

4) Also I don't know if the ""Event Services"" refers to BMPS helping out with bringing a sound engineer and equipment to TMC RR events? If so then I would rate it ""satisfactory."""
Congrats on response time and being cheerfully available when needed!  ????
Everyone at TSG is great!
Great job TSG! Thank you for all you do.
"Helpdesk: Sometimes the representative will keep you on hold unnecessarily when you could have gotten a simple call back. I have a hard time working with Lisa and Maurice because of how they conduct themselves on the telephone. Very kind people so there is no problem there but could conduct themselves in a more professional way.

General support/CSM accounts:Tony Veidelis and Sean Austin have been exceptional and it is always a pleasure to work with them. They go above and beyond."
"I mostly work with TSG folks above and they are SUPER! That having been said I know that some are newer and are working to get up to speed on TMC applications etc. But there are two individuals that continue to absolutely shine in their work with me (and others by observation) and go the extra mile in attitude courteous-ness etc. 

That having been said I did have one difficulty recently with one of my service ticket requests that had a short time frame placed on a Thursday followed up with a personal email to one employee that I had asked questions along these lines before. I was surprised to not hear from them at all either by email or in response to the TSG ticket until I happen to be talking to that person on Monday but the event was past by that time. I was too busy on the Friday to follow up as I should have. I was also a little vague in my time frame too. I didn't follow up when I became aware their help would have been nice to receive by that Friday. It  occasionally appears to me that they are SO busy they don't always have the time to follow up. Do we possibly need one more employee in that part of things?

On the flip side occasionally I find that I cannot help with the follow up they may want to do (they are being proactive) because it takes up so much time that I often don't have and I sometimes have to abandon a particular issue especially as it relates to getting into my computer during work hours. Sorry! Also very rarely I have done a quick Google search and found the answer myself. Thank you to TSG for all you guys do! Not an easy job. :)"
Thank You!
The help desk really needs some work. Nice (new) people but the person I worked with didn't seem like she knew what was going on.  
The one area that I would not quite say I'm satisfied with is support for M-Files.  Austin has always been fantastic to work with (as was Stephanie) but without an admin who is able to devote a bit more time to refining the system and addressing the issues that are not urgent but still important ORM has found itself putting off projects or aspects of data clean up with no clear plan for when they can be addressed.
TSG should strive to respond in a timely manner.
"TSG support of business applications is timely though the business applications themselves have not consistently met the needs of our department. (Enterprise has gone done on a number of occasions and Salesforce has not yet implemented cloud services.)

Slow implementation of Salesforce cloud services (more than 1 year behind schedule) is negatively affecting ISD's & Customer Care Center's ability to have a backup employee for ISD in a crucial role because we have not been able to train someone on the new cloud service. (To train the backup on the current service would require duplicating work when cloud service is implemented). We understand that this delay is due to Salesforce techs needing to customize the configuration for TMC/CSPS because they did not deliver what they originally promised. We also recognize that managing this process has required significant human resources from TSG for vendor management but hope that more TSG resources can be devoted to managing the vendor relationship with Salesforce so that the cloud service can be implemented ASAP."
