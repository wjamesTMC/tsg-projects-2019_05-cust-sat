"As of this afternoon, Luci had not received their payment for May through July 5th ($191,000). What have you seen on your end? If you have any news, please let me know and I will pass it along."
"I apologize for not getting this invoice paid on Thursday.  I spoke with Jacob and he did get the PO updated for future invoices, but didn't update the date already in the system for this invoice that had been entered previously.  I'm confident we'll be able to get an ACH payment request out today that Luci Creative will have in their account tomorrow.  There are actually 2 invoices pending, #2401 for $193,933 and #2404 for $2,006.70.  We'll pay them both today."
"I hope this delay hasn't created too much hardship on their end.  As stated previously, their PO has been updated, so all future invoices should be paid out on the first payment cycle after they're received."
"Just sending confirmation that the ACH payment file for these two invoices, for a total of $195,928.70, has been uploaded to our bank.  Luci Creative should see this payment in their account tomorrow morning."
"Many, many thanks Tat. I GREATLY appreciate your efforts to make this happen."
No problem.  So sorry about not getting it paid out last week.  Jacob and I had a discussion about making sure we follow up properly to make sure these special requests don't slip through the cracks when we're rushing to get all the payments out on Thursdays.
