### Overview

This report analyzes the occurrences of positive and negative vocabulary words in the comments field of the TSG customer satisfaction surveys. 

While an examination of the words used by responders is not completely precise, it can provide some useful insight into how responders are thinking and what troubles (or delights) them most. For example, the word "help" could be construed as positive or negative (e.g., "was a big help" vs. "no help at all") but a manual review of all the comments suggests that it is always used in a positive context, and therefore was made a "positive" word. Totaling the number of occurrences of positives and negatives and looking at various ratos can provide some sense of how happy responders are (and with what). 

In contrast, it is also possible to generate (automatically) a word cloud of *all* the words used in the comments (excluding common words such as "a", the", "in" and so forth). This provides a high level (and different) view which provides some additional insightslike the name of a help desk person who has been particularly helpful and therefore called out (e.g., "Sean"). However, word clouds do not differentiate between positive and negative, and some words (like "Service Desk") are left in that are less useful in trying to establish an overall tone.

Working with the comments confirmed the value of constructing a specific vocabularly to run against the comment fields.

This report includes graphs to help visualize the relative number of occurrences per comment, and to compare the various proportions / ratios of positives and negatives. The graphs and charts provide some insight into trends, but with only three surveys to work with, these trends have to be looked on as tentative.

### Approach

Positive / negative vocabularly words were selected by reading through the comments manually, examining the context, and selecting those that would, in as many cases as possible, be unambiguous. The code reads each comment, and tabulates the number of occurrences of each word on the list - cumulatively, and by individual survey.

Graphs then chart the total positive and negative occurrences, and compares these totals in various ways to establish a sense of tone, and then compares positive and negative totals with each other to see if both are going up, down, or trending differently.

As a side note, the word "Enterprise" (referring to the business application) appears to be rather negatively perceived by survey responders, and was given its own entry in the negative vocabularly list.

### Findings

With only three surveys taken to date, it is difficult to be certain about trends, but it *appears* that the following conclusions could be reached:

* The number of comments is increasing with each survey
* The number of positive vocabularly occurrences is increasing with each survey
* The number of positive vocabularly occurrences is increasing faster than the increase in comments
* The number of negative vocabularly occurrences is decreasing with each survey, but slowly
* The number of negative vocuabulary occurrences is noticeably less than the number of positive occurrences

In short, the positives are going up and the negatives are going down. This could be a fact, but also could be coincidental.

**Summary**

* Number of survey responses      : `r nrow(wkgdat)`
* Number of survey comments       : `r num_comments`
* Comments to responses ratio     : `r round(num_comments / nrow(wkgdat), digits = 2)`
* Number of positive words        : `r pct`
* Positive words to comments ratio: `r pos_index`
* Number of negative words        : `r nct`
* Negative words to comments ratio: `r neg_index`

**Overall Summary of Individual Survey Statistics**

Translation of field names:

* num_resp = number of responses
* num_comments = the number of comments in the survey
* c_to_r_ratio = the number of comments divided by the number of responses
* num_pos_words = the number of positive words found in the survey
* pw_to_c_ratio = the number of positive words divided by the number of comments
* num_neg_words = the number of negative words found in the survey
* nw_to_c_ratio = the number of negative words divided by the number of comments
